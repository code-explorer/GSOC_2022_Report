        <p>
            <a href="https://tardis-sn.github.io/">TARDIS</a> is an open-source
            Monte Carlo radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code for 1D models of
            supernova ejecta. It is designed for rapid spectral modelling of
            supernovae. The mission of the TARDIS community is to develop
            open-source software instruments to analyze and simulate astronomical
            transients (supernovae, kilonovae, etc.) for research and education
            purposes.
        </p>

            In this report, I go over the various contributions I made to TARDIS
            over the summer.

        <h4 class="sub-title">Objective 1: Saving Simulations to HDF</h4>
        <p>
            TARDIS had an existing method to store simulations to a HDF file.
            However, there was not enough data being stored in order to re-create
            the simulation from the HDF file. So, my first objective was to create
            methods to store and re-create different parts of the simulation. The
            simulation consists of 3 main parts which are the model, the plasma and
            the runner.

                <a href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/2052">#2052</a> adds
                interfaces to store and load the model and runner object from a HDF
                file.

        <h4 class="sub-title">Objective 2: Refactoring model state</h4>
        <p>
            TARDIS currently only works with radial 1D models. However, for future
            expansion, a model was needed which can work with other geometries. The
            model state was refactored as shown below to allow this:

                restructured model state by moving over parts of the Radial1DModel to
                the Model class.
